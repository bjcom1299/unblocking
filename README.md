# unblocking
unblocking programming is very important to the performance of your applicaiton.
especially in network programming.
libcurl is mainly a network programing lib in c language, also curl is good tool to test.
libevent gives us the tool for dealing with events unblockingly.
In this project I will show some examples in c language to demonstrate the difference between blocking and unblocking.
